Perceived-Quality: 
i) The DFS crawler picked first urls from first page of each depth and went to the last depth and from there kept backtracking but reached till depth 5 only.So the urls collected from this search diverged quickly from the initial topic  i.e. "Solar Eclipse" and kept on traversing over pages of arbitrary topics.

ii)The BFS crawler could only reach till depth 4 before exhausting the 1000 page limit.Since this crawler visited all the links in a certain depth first before moving on to the next depth, the urls collected from this crawler are more related to the given topic, i.e. "Solar Eclipse"

So in conclusion,in this the given graph, BFS crawl performed better over DFS crawl

Efficiency Aspect:
 DFS-Crawl took 31 minutes and BFS crawl took 31 minutes.So for the given search space BFS and DFS performed equally in terms of time efficience

Coverage of given topic:

For BFS crawl:
--There were 563 occurences of the given topic(Solar eclipse) in the urls collected when searched for "solar" or "eclipse"
--There were 461 occurences of the given topic(Solar eclipse) in the urls collected when searched for "solar" and "eclipse"

For DFS crawl:

--There were 3 occurences of the given topic(Solar eclipse) in the urls collected when searched for "solar" or "eclipse"
--There were 1 occurences of the given topic(Solar eclipse) in the urls collected when searched for "solar" and "eclipse"
