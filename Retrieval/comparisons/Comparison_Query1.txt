Observation:
--Between the top 5 documents only 1 document named "Dark_Moon" is common.
--By looking at the names of documents fetched, lucene gives a more topically relevant set of documents
--in BM25 4 documents are somewhat topically related to the query,except for Naked_Eye.Naked eye has "dark" 12 times and "moon" 6 times, 
  thus achieved a pseudo relevance
-- As the corpus size is really small, few words which are related to the seed url, are  present in a large number of documents,thus in BM25 calculation,
   when log is applied on those words, their value becomes negative an thus gets a lower score.This might be a reason for absence of topically relevant 
   documents in BM25 list
