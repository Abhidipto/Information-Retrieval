Observation:

-- As the corpus size is really small, few words which are related to the seed url, are  present in a large number of documents,thus in BM25 calculation,
   when log is applied on those words, their value becomes negative an thus gets a lower score.This might be a reason for absence of topically relevant 
   documents in BM25 list
   
--Thus the documents fetched by BM25 are the least relevant to query.For example all the 5 documents  has 0 occurrence of the terms in query

   
--Lucene gives a much more relevant set of documents. For example , the first document "Solar_Saros_136"  has the following term counts:

total-->59
solar-->16
eclipse-->24

total solar-->7
solar eclipse-->11
total solar eclipse-->7
